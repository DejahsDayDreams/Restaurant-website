# Restaurant-website
a simple HTML and CSS restaurant website


I have planned and created a website for a new restaurant to attract potential customers.
I wanted to do something with a clean but inviting look and beautiful images of the food offered in the restaurant.

I have structured and planned out the following pages:

•	Home page – to welcome the customers and give them insight into the restaurant.
•	Menu page – where the customers can look at what the restaurant has to offer and decide if they want to eat with us.
•	Contact page – where the customers can get in touch with the restaurant for any queries etc.
